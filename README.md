# Decision-trees-and-why-not-to-use-them

This model utilizes a dataset on customers of the RR Diner Coffee Company with regard to interest in a new brand of coffee.  Decision tree analysis is used comparing different types of split quality of the trees and pruning trees with a max depth of 3 compared to no pruning. Also, the Decision Trees are compared to  a Random Forest model, which is more robust.
